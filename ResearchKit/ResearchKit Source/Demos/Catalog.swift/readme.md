The intent of this sample is to guide developers through the different
kinds of elements they can use to present a task in ResearchKit, such
as surveys, informed consent, and active tasks.
    
This sample demonstrates how to use different ResearchKit model
elements to construct a task, how to present a task view controller,
and how to handle the delegate callbacks from the task view controller.

This sample also shows the structure of the results collected by each
such task. To see what results are collected by a task, start the app,
do the task, and then check the results tab to see and navigate the
result hierarchy.

Since it is written in Swift, this example also provides a simple
environment for verifying that the functionality of ResearchKit is
adequately available to Swift.

`Catalog.swift` is currently written in Swift 1.1 and requires Xcode
6.2 with an iOS 8.2 SDK.
