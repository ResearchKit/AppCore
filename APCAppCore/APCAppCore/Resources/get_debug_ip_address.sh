# Notes on this "if" statement syntax:

# -	The CONFIGURATION variable is provided by Xcode:  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/XcodeBuildSettingRef/1-Build_Setting_Reference/build_setting_ref.html
#
# -	The "[" is a COMMAND.  Leave spaces before and after it.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4277665/how-do-i-compare-two-string-variables-in-an-if-statement-in-bash
#
# - The "then" goes on the next line:  it's a separate
#	command from the "if" line.  (Help link:  same as
#	for the "[", above.)

	# A little shell script to extract the build machine's IP address
	#
	# Here's what each component of the line below does.  Mentally split
	# it into pieces at each "|" ("pipe") character:
	#
	#	ifconfig:
	#		run "ifconfig".  This generates a page of IP address data:
	#		wireless, wired, IPv6, everything.  We need to filter it.
	#
	#	egrep ...
	#		shove the results of "ifconfig" through  "egrep," looking
	#		for patterns like: "inet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx".
	#
	#	cut ...
	#		shove the results of egrep through "cut," which extracts
	#		the 2nd space-delimited column of data:  the IP address.
	#
	#	grep -v ...
	#		the "cut" operation gave us 2 IP addresses.  Remove the one
	#		with a "127" in it.  The result should be our machine's real
	#		IP address.
	#
	#	`...`
	#		By wrapping the whole thing in a pair of "backtick"
	#		marks (reverse single-quotation marks), we tell
	#		Unix:  please run this line of code, put the results
	#		into a string, and feed me the string.
	#
	ipAddress=`ifconfig | egrep -o "inet (\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+)\\D" | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | grep -v "127"`


	# Store it as a key/value pair in a file in the build's
	# temp directory (which happens to be inside the compiled
	# executable package, as a .plist file).  Search the code
	# for the string "BUILD_MACHINE_IP_ADDRESS" to see how
	# we're using this.
	defaults write "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${INFOPLIST_PATH%.*}" "BUILD_MACHINE_IP_ADDRESS" "${ipAddress}"

	echo "We're in 'DataVerificationServer' mode.  Saving build machine's IP address, [${ipAddress}], into a .plist file, in variable BUILD_MACHINE_IP_ADDRESS, for use in the app."
