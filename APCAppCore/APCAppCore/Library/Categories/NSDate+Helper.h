/**
 Adds the specified duration string to the specified
 date.  Duration strings follow the ISO 8601 standard.
 Some examples:

 @code
 P3D        3 days ("P" == "period")
 P1W        1 week
 P2D5H10S   2 days, 5 hours, and 10 seconds
 P36H       36 hours, i.e., a day and a half
 P1.5D      a day and a half, i.e., 36 hours
 @endcode
 
 If you want to include minutes, you'll need a (T)ime
 indicator somewhere to the left of it, to distinguish it
 from months.  Like this:

 @code
 P3DT5M     3 days + 5 minutes
 @endcode
 
 You can use any time interval from (S)econds through
 (Y)ears, except fortnights.  Time will be measured in
 terms of the interval:  1.5D and 36H both give you a
 day and a half, but 1M or 1Y will give you different
 numbers of days, depending on the months and leap years
 as measured from startDate.  If you specify a startDate
 of nil, you'll get 30 days per month and 365 days per
 year.

 @param duration An ISO 8601 duration string, as described
 above.

 @param date A date from which to start counting.  Mostly
 matters for durations involving months:  "P1M" (1 month)
 means different things if you start on January 1 or
 February 1, and if months or years go far enough, we have
 to account for leap years.  So:  if you specify nil, the
 calculation will use 30 days per month (every month) and
 365 days per year.  If you specify a real date, the
 calculations will account for the actual number of days
 per month during the elapsed months, and will account for
 leap years.
