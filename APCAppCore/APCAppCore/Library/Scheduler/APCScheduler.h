/**
 Manages tasks and schedules.
 
 Specifically, manages the processes of downloading tasks
 and schedules, merging them with existing ones, figuring
 out which ones are active on a given day, and figuring out
 which to display on a given day, whether present, past, or
 future.  Maintains a cache of the query results for each
 type of query, because each query is time-consuming: we
 not only pull stuff from CoreData, but do a fair amount of
 math to figure out how to map schedules onto a human
 calendar.
 
 Combines features formerly in several other classes, so
 we can see and debug them in the same place.  These
 features are those which either query or manipulate 
 tasks, schedules, PotentialTasks, and some aspects of
 ScheduledTasks.

 In former versions of the app, tasks were "scheduled" out
 into the future, based on their projected dates of
 appearance.  When their schedules changed, those
 ScheduledTask objects were modified.  This new Scheduler
 class represents a different paradigm: instead of
 scheduling tasks into the future, we simply maintain a
 Schedule -- a set of rules about when tasks should appear
 on a user's calendar.  Whenever we want to display the
 calendar, we query the schedule.  Only when the user wants
 to actually *perform* one of those tasks do we create a
 ScheduledTask object representing the task being performed
 and/or completed, and if the user cancels the task, we
 delete that ScheduledTask.
