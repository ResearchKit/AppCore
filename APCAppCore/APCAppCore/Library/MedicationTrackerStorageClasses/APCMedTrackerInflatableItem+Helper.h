 The +fetchAll methods will call you back when

 Note that "arrayOfGeneratedObjects" and "error" are
 passed to you straight from the output of a CoreData
 "fetch request."  This means we have to interpret them
 in precise ways:
 - the array will be nil if there was an error
 - the array will have stuff in it if there was stuff to be found
 - the array will be empty if there were no items of the type you
 requested.  You may consider this an error -- it depends on
 your business logic.

 Please see -[NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:]
 for a formal and complete description of those rules.
