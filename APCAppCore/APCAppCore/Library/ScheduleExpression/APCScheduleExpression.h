/**
 
 The `APCScheduleExpression` class is the public interface for scheduled backed by a modified cron expression.
 
 Example usage:
    APCScheduleExpression*    schedule   = [[APCScheduleExpression alloc] initWithExpression:@"A 5 * * * *" timeZero:0];
    NSEnumerator*   enumerator = [schedule enumeratorBeginningAtTime:[dateFormatter dateFromString:@"2014-01-01 06:00"]];

    NSDate* date;
    while ((date = enumerator.nextObject))
    {
        NSLog(@"Date: %@", date);
    }

 
 A *schedule* represents a potentially infinite sequence of `moments` (date-time events).
 The supported cron expression is as follows:
 
 * * * * *  task id
 │ │ │ │ │
 │ │ │ │ │
 │ │ │ │ └──────── day of week
 │ │ │ └────────── month
 │ │ └──────────── day of month
 │ └────────────── hour
 └──────────────── minutes
 
                                Allowed     Special
    Index   Field Name          Values      Characters      Note
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    0:      Minutes             0-59        * , -
    1:      Hours               0-23        * , -
    2:      Day of month        1-31        * , -
    3:      Month               1-12        * , -           1: Jan, 2: Feb, ..,, 12: Dec
    4:      Day of week         0-6         * , -           0: Sun, 1: Mon, ..., 6: Sat

    *   Matches all values. Example: an ‘*’ in the Day of Month field means every day.
    ,   Separate items of a list. Example: 7,14,21 for the Day of Week field means the 7th, 14th,
        and 21st day on the month.
    -   Ranges. Example: 9-12 for the Month field means Sept through December.

 A schedule is considered satisified if all the date and time fields match the provided date and time
 (logical conjunction). There is a partial relaxation if the Day of Week and Day of Month are restricted
 (ie, not '*'); these two fields are logical disjunction.
