Steps for spinning off a new project
-------------------------------------

1) Clone the project and create a README file in master branch per instructions in bitbucket blank project page.
2) Clone the project locally using git clone.
3) Create `dev` branch and push it to origin.
4) Add AppleCore submodule with the below command

git submodule add https://bitbucket.org/ymedialabs/applecore.git AppleCore

5) Add .gitignore from an existing project & commit.

6) Create blank single screen xcode project in the desired name. After creation, copy the `.xcodeproj` and the main directory in the parent directory. This is to ensure that AppleCore directory resides along with `.xcodeproj`.

8) Change AppleCore to dev branch
9) Pull AppleCore project as subproject to main project.

14) Add all the necessary Frameworks from other project. Add appropriate entitlements in Capabilities screen.
15) Update main.m file to include APHAppDelegate.
16) Update "Framework Search Paths" to include.
17) App should compile at this point without problem.
18) Update AppDelegate with study identifier. 
19) Clear custom tasks & steps unless they are common.
